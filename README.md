# Pig-Game

A simple two-player dice game built with JavaScript that focuses on risk-taking and decision-making.

## How the Game Works
- The game is played by **two players** who take turns rolling a dice.
- On each turn, a player can **continue rolling** to collect more points or **hold** to save the current score.
- If the player rolls a **1**, the turn immediately ends and **all points collected in that turn are lost**.
- The turn then passes to the **next player**.
- The first player who reaches a total score of **100 points** wins the game.

## Game Concept
This game highlights the idea of **risk management**, since players must decide whether to:
- Keep rolling to gain more points  
- Or stop early to protect their current score  

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, game state handling, and event logic)

## Purpose of the Project
This project demonstrates:
- Interactive game logic in JavaScript  
- Managing player state and turns  
- Event-driven programming and DOM updates  
- Implementing simple strategic gameplay mechanics
